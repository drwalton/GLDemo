# GLDemo #

This tiny library contains some helper classes for building tiny OpenGL tech demos with FreeGLUT, GLM and OpenCTM.
 
## Dependencies ##

* glew: http://sourceforge.net/projects/glew/
* glm: http://sourceforge.net/projects/ogl-math/
* openCTM: http://sourceforge.net/projects/openctm/

## Examples ##

Included in this repository are the following example projects:

### Silhouette ###

This is a demo of a number of simple ways to render silhouettes and perform cel-shading in modern OpenGL.

Much more detail on this demo can be found in [this post](http://drwalton.github.io/2013/10/18/silhouette-rendering.html).

### Quartic Flame ###

This is a demo of a fast particle system for simulating fire. The demo is almost complete, and a post will be published soon.
